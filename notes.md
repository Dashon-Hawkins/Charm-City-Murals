# Our Vision

The HopHacksDreamTeam wants to create an app for social good. We see primary
avenues as enabling local muicpalities to be smarter and better, or to directly
empower the people of Baltimore to have better experience.

This is a list of our initial ideas, and our thought process.

## Initial Idea Phase

  - [ ] Trash collection routing
   - Request pcikups
   - Image recognition for pickups

  - [ ] Chatbot to help people through enrollment
   - Baltimore themed
   - Text messaging
   - Chat app

  - [ ] Placing routing for police traffic, fire

  - [ ] Parking for balitmore

  - [x] AR for balitmore murals
   - Baltimore love project
   - Process for mural approval

  - [ ] Suggest new best routes to ease congestion
   - Simulate traffic
   - Determine what bus routes, trains would ease congestion

  - [ ] Smart Mesh networks.

## And so it was decided.

Let there be code.
